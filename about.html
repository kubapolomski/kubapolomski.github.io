        <p>
            I'm a Product Designer focused on solving problems by digging deep to find the&nbsp;root cause. Thanks to my
            experience, I'm able to design products from&nbsp;scratch that users and stakeholders will love.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have worked on various products for Insurance, Fintech, HR&nbsp;(Time&nbsp;Tracking/Planning), and
            Affiliate
            Marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my work, I don't just focus on making wireframes, mock-ups, or diagrams but&nbsp;on solving real-world
            problems
            in a way that will meet users and business goals.
        </p>
