                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    At EasySend, our business clients had their own version of the Dashboard. The main difference
                    between individual and business apps was the Wallet - the currency accounts. Our clients could
                    top-up the Wallet in their native currency and exchange it in seconds, with a minimum fee. Then they
                    could pay like the local - e.g., for invoices in foreign currency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As our Customer Service was getting a few negative reviews after releasing the Business Panel, I
                    was asked to investigate the cause of the unenthusiastic feedback.
                </p>

                    <span>The Process</span>
                    <h3>1. Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        I started by observing user behavior with tools like HotJar and Google Analytics. I quickly
                        realized that many of our users had problems navigating the Dashboard. There was a lot of
                        running in
                        circles. Sometimes they're just jumping between every single item in the navigation system to
                        find the information they're looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to gather more information, so I decided to run usability tests.
                    </p>

                <!-- 2. Usability tests -->

                    <span>The Process</span>
                    <h3>2. Usability tests</h3>
                    <p>
                        I ran sessions with a few of our existing clients and few potential clients - owners of a
                        business who haven't used our service yet but could do that in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that, I knew what caused these problems, and now I had to find solutions for them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        At first, I focused on the idea of the onboarding - explaining how the Business Panel works and
                        how
                        to operate it. That should do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other ideas included providing access to a Demo account and contextual helpers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Then I realized that it was a too easy solution. Easy for us - fast to deliver, simple to
                        implement - but not much better experience for our users.<br>
                        I decided to go with redesigning the whole Information Architecture as it will produce
                        much better results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I quickly jumped into Sketch and started rewriting the IA. While doing that, I've also started
                        working on other things, which we identified as little confusing in usability tests.

                    Besides changing only IA, I've also added a few minor changes, like changing exchange rates chart to
                    more pleasing one, and adding clear call-to-action to every component that needed it.
