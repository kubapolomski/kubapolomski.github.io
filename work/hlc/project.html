                <p>
                    I worked under NDA on this project, so I can't show you most of visuals. I would like to just
                    describe my design process.

                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>
                    I was asked to design an app for insurance agents, who had to do hazard identification and risk
                    assessment for companies across different markets. The risk assessments were to be performed through
                    buildings and processes audits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Audits were performed in front of the competition (other insurance companies) in the same room.
                    Everyone was asking questions for their surveys (on different topics). Therefore, switching between
                    different parts of the survey was an essential skill. The questionnaire consisted of around 1500
                    questions, with 4 tiers of hierarchy.
                </p>

            <h2>The process</h2>

            <section>
                <h3>1. Research</h3>

                <p>
                    Users: Group of specialists (fire protection, electrical engineering, building engineering, and
                    more) taking care of corporate clients. Around a dozen people from over a five hundred employees
                    company.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since our users were highly specialized in the task they were performing, I had to be sure I
                    understood their job correctly. I wanted to make their work easier and faster, so I had to avoid
                    making any assumptions.
                </p>

                <h4>Methods</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Few iterations of workshops/interviews with stakeholders and key-specialists to set project
                        vision
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Card-sorting session to break questionnaires into smaller chunks, easier for agents to digest
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interviews with users to set tasks they were performing
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Results (a.k.a.&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done)</h4>

                <ul class="results with-headers">
                    <li>
                        <span>Stand out from the competition</span>
                        <span>
                            The survey was conducted in a group meeting with competition in the same room. Everyone was
                            asking different questions about a different part of the company. Competitors were mostly
                            using Excel documents on their laptops with and similar document templates - just like our
                            users.
                        </span>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <span>Be lightning fast</span>
                        <span>
                            Since the survey was conducted in a group, our user had to be fast enough to switch from
                            topic to topic. Other surveyors weren’t helpful by asking different questions for different
                            parts of the production
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Include photos</span>
                        <span>
                            Our users were taking a lot of photos - documents, certifications, machinery, etc.
                            They needed to switch fast between taking a photo and conducting a survey. Some of them
                            should
                            be included in the final report of the questionnaires
                        </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Around 1500 questions</span>
                        <span>
                            This is a lot of questions that could be asked. By a lot, I mean <strong>a lot</strong>.
                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </div>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>2. Ideation sessions</h3>

                <p>I did ideation sessions with stakeholders and few agents at client headquarters.</p>

                <h4>Results</h4>

                <ul class="results with-headers">
                    <li>
                        <span>iPad Pro app</span>
                        <span>Imagine one of the agents pulling out their iPad Pro which was
                            instantaneously ready, while others had to take out their laptops, power cables, mice,
                            cameras,
                            etc. We were
                            sure that the new way of working would be standing out from what competition had.
                        </span>
                        <br>
                        <span>iPad was also great at taking photos, so agents wouldn't have to take
                            additional
                            pieces of equipment with them. The stylus was an extra feature that could help our users
                            making
                            fast sketches (i.e., on photos). Therefore, all the work could be done on one device - no
                            memory
                            cards, no switching between different apps, devices, etc.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>The survey-based on switch components</span>
                        <span>To speed up work I came up with the switch-based screen, which only would
                            need 1 tap to “check”</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>Showing deeper levels only when parent switch was turned on</span>
                        <span>
                            I wanted to make sure UI is not cluttered with unnecessary questions. Thanks to having only
                            top-level questions for a new project, our users were presented with a clear UI that could
                            be
                            expanded during the questionnaire process.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Prototypes</h3>

                <p>The most challenging screen was the one with the survey. I iterated many times to make it highly
                    usable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>5. Implementation</h3>

                <p>
                    During implementation, I worked hand-in-hand with developers to make sure everything worked as
                    intended. We shared the early-beta version of the app with our users, so we could receive feedback
                    (if
                    any errors occurred, API connection worked, etc.) and pivot if needed.
                </p>

                <h4>Results</h4>

                <ul class="results">
                    <li>Application proudly presented at board meetings</li>
                    <li>High users’ satisfaction</li>
                    <li>1 tool to work with (in contrast to laptop, camera, many apps)</li>
                    <li>Agents standing out from the competition</li>
                    <li>Much easier and faster survey completion and switching between topics</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>
                    Final thoughts
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When the 1.0 version was shipped to our customer, I already knew that we could do a much better job
                    if we would work in the Agile/Scrum framework. Delivering small parts of the app and then testing
                    them with real users. But we were working in Waterfall, so the whole app was built upfront. Of
                    course, prototypes helped, but still, that would save us a lot of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>One of things I'm proud of is the Summary screen</strong> <br>
                    I had to combine 4 different parts of the questionnaire into one chart
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the score of the whole domain
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        importance (weight) of areas in the given domain
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the scores of different sections in the area
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the scores of subsections
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    I've searched through every chart collection and couldn't find anything that would work in this
                    scenario.</p>
                <p>
                    So here's what I came up with:
                </p>

                <img src="/work/hlc/img/summary.png"
                    alt="Wireframe of the summary chart showing up 3 different levels of scoring">
                <p>
                    It was a combination between the Pie Chart and the Polar Area Chart.
                    The weight was shown as Pie Chart (width of the section), and its score was shown as Polar Area
                    Chart (radius of the section).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every section was tappable, so it would reveal subsections, and it's scoring.
                </p>
