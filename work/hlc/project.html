            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>I was asked to design an app for insurance agents, who had to do hazard identification and risk
                assessment
                for
                companies across different markets. The risk assessments were to be performed through buildings and
                processes audits.
            </p>

            <p>Audits were performed in front of the competition (other insurance companies) in the same room. Everyone
                was
                asking questions for their surveys (on different topics). Therefore, switching between different parts
                of
                the
                survey was a key skill. The questionnaire consisted of around 1500 questions, with 4 tiers of hierarchy.
            </p>

            <h2>The process</h2>

            <h3>Research</h3>

            <p>Users: Group of specialists (fire protection, electrical engineering, building engineering, and more)
                taking
                care
                of corporate clients. Around a dozen people from over a five hundred employees company.</p>

            <p>Since our users were highly specialised in the task they were performing, I had to be sure I
                understood
                their
                job
                perfectly. I wanted to make their work easier and faster, so I had to avoid making any assumptions.
            </p>

            <h4>Methods</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Few iterations of workshops/interviews with stakeholders and key-specialists to set project
                    vision
                </li>
                <li>Card-sorting session to break questionnaires into smaller chunks, easier for agents to digest
                </li>
                <li>Interviews with users to set tasks they were performing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research outcome - main goals</h3>

            <p><strong>Stand out from the competition</strong><br />
                The survey was conducted in a group meeting with competition in the same room. Everyone was asking
                different
                questions, about a different part of the company. Competitors were mostly using Excel documents on
                their
                laptops
                with and similar document templates - just like our </p>

            <p><strong>Be lightning fast</strong><br />
                Since the survey was conducted in a group, our user had to be fast enough to switch from topic to
                topic.
                Other
                surveyors weren’t helpful by asking different questions for different parts of the production</p>

            <p><strong>Include photos</strong><br />
                Our users were taking a lot of photos - documents, certifications, machinery, etc.</p>

            <p>They needed to switch fast between taking a photo and conducting a survey. Some of them should be
                included in
                the
                final report of the questionnaire</p>

            <p><strong>Around 1500 questions</strong><br />
                This is a lot of questions that could be asked. By a lot, I mean a lot.</p>

            <h3>Deliverables</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Lo-fi sketches</li>
                <li>Mid and Hi-fi mock-ups (Photoshop, Sketch)</li>
                <li>User-flows, diagrams</li>
                <li>InVision prototypes</li>
                <li>app-map</li>
                <li>Full app analysis (approx. 60-page Document) that was used by developers</li>
                <li>Feature list</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 3 - Ideation sessions</h2>

            <p>I did ideation sessions with stakeholders and few agents at client headquarters.</p>

            <p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

            <p>To generate different solutions that we could test with prototypes.</p>

            <p><strong>Results</strong></p>

            <p>• iPad Pro app</p>

            <p>Imagine one of the agents pulling out their iPad Pro which was instantaneously ready, while others
                had to
                take
                out their laptops, power cables, mice, cameras, etc. We were sure that the new way of working would
                be
                standing
                out from what competition had.</p>

            <p>iPad was also great at taking photos, so agents wouldn't have to take additional pieces of equipment
                with
                them.
                The stylus was an extra feature that could help our users making fast sketches (i.e., on photos).
                Therefore,
                all
                the work could be done on one device - no memory cards, no switching between different apps,
                devices,
                etc.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The survey was based on switch components</p>
                    To speed up work I came up with the switch-based screen, which only would need 1 tap to “check”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Showing deeper levels only when parent switch was turned on</p>
                    I wanted to make sure UI is not cluttered with unnecessary questions. Thanks to having only
                    top-level
                    questions for a new project, our users were presented with a clear UI that could be expanded
                    during
                    the
                    questionnaire process.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Phase 4 - Prototypes</h2>

            <p>The most challenging screen was the one with the survey. I iterated many times to make it highly
                usable
                and
                aesthetically pleasing.</p>

            <p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

            <p>To make sure interactions are easy to understand and perform, and to improve the structure of the
                surveys
            </p>

            <p><strong>Results</strong></p>

            <p>• 6 iteration of survey screens</p>

            <p>• Polished interactions, so every agent could do them easily • List of additional features to include
                in
                next
                version</p>

            <h2>Phase 5 - Tests</h2>

            <p>Goals</p>

            <p>To choose the best solution for our users</p>

            <p>Results</p>

            <p>• Changed user-flow to match users’ expectations</p>

            <p>• Changed list of features to include in the first release (few of them were moved to</p>

            <p>next versions)</p>

            <h2>Phase 6 - Implement</h2>

            <p>During implementation, I worked hand-in-hand with developers to make sure everything worked as
                intended.
                We
                shared the early-beta version of the app with our users, so we could receive feedback (if any errors
                occurred,
                API connection worked, etc.) and pivot if needed.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Application proudly presented at board meetings</li>
                <li>High users’ satisfaction</li>
                <li>1 tool to work with (in contrast to laptop, camera, many apps)</li>
                <li>Agents standing out from the competition</li>
                <li>Much easier survey completion and switching between topics</li>
